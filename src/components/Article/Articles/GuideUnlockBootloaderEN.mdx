In this guide, I will show you how to unlock the bootloader of our device. This process will format your device, so I recommend you to make a backup before.

All this is at your own risk, I'm not responsible for any damage caused to your device.

## **¿What I need?**

- ### **SDK Platform Tools**
    
    The _Android SDK Platform tools_ are a component of the Android SDK. They include tools that interact with the Android platform, such as <code><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb">adb</a></code>, <code><a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/fastboot/#fastboot">fastboot</a></code> y <code><a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/tracing/command-line">systrace</a></code>. These tools are required for Android app development, or if you want to unlock the bootloader of your device and update it with a new system image.

- ### **Motorola Drivers**
    
    This contains the USB drivers so that the PC can recognize your device and work with it when it is in Bootloader or Fastbootd.
    
    Download link - [Motorola](https://motorola-global-es-latam.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/89882)
    
- ### **Windows Terminal (optional)**
    
    If you have windows 8, 8.1 or 10, download this terminal from the Windows Store, as you will get a feature that you will need in this guide. Once you have obtained the terminal, configure it so that the default profile is the command prompt (CMD).
    
    Download link - [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701)
    
- ### **USB debugging (optional)**
    
    In this guide we will use USB debugging to access the bootloader mode, it is not necessary if you are already in bootloader mode or if you are going to access it in another way (with a buttons combination), but I recommend the way it is going to be shown in this guide.
    
    To enable USB debugging, you have to go to the settings app, in the "About phone" section under "Build number" and tap 7 times. Then, you have to access the "Developer options" in the settings app under "System" and enable "USB debugging".
    
- ### **Activate "OEM Unlock"**
    
    Go to "Settings/System/Advanced Settings/Developer" and there, look for the "OEM Unlock" option to activate it.
    

## **Procedure for unlocking the bootloader**

1. Unzip the platform-tools folder you got from the page **Android Developers**.

2. If you have the **Windows Terminal** obtained from the **Microsoft Store**, simply open the CMD inside the folder by right-clicking on an empty part of the folder and selecting the "Open in Terminal" option.

	If you don't have the **Windows Terminal**, inside the folder in an empty space, shift+right-click and select the option "Open PowerShell window here", type `cmd` inside the window and press enter.

3. Connect the device to the PC, type in the CMD `adb devices` (the phone has to be on for this command to work, in case it is already in bootloader, type `fastboot devices`) and press enter. If the console doesn't return

    ```bash
    List of devices   attached
    ZE222BZWFF        device
    ```
    
    then make sure you have your device properly connected, or have enabled USB debugging.
    
4. Now reboot to the bootloader (if you aren't in it) with `adb reboot bootloader` or with the key combination "volume - and power" (you have to hold down these buttons until the bootloader screen appears).
    
    Either way, this will access the bootloader, which has a screen with text and the Android robot lying down with an open lid.
    

The next steps will be on [this](https://en-us.support.motorola.com/app/standalone%2Fbootloader%2Funlock-your-device-b) Motorola page, but I'll explain it anyway.

5. Inside the previously opened terminal, type `fastboot oem get_unlock_data`. This command will drop your device ID into the terminal, which you will need to obtain an unlock code.
    
    The ID will be displayed as follows on Windows/Linux:

	```bash
	(bootloader) 0A40040192024205#4C4D3556313230
	(bootloader) 30373731363031303332323239#BD00
	(bootloader) 8A672BA4746C2CE02328A2AC0C39F95
	(bootloader) 1A3E5#1F53280002000000000000000
	(bootloader) 0000000
	```
   
	And as follows in MAC:

	```bash
	INFO0A40040192024205#4C4D3556313230
	INFO30373731363031303332323239#BD00
	INFO8A672BA4746C2CE02328A2AC0C39F95
	INFO1A3E5#1F53280002000000000000000
	INFO0000000
	```
    
6. You will need to generate your unlock code from what the CMD displays, to do this, you will need to paste the 5 lines of output in a continuous string without "bootloader or info" and without blanks. The code should look like this:
    
	```bash
	0A40040192024205#4C4D355631323030373731363031303332323239#BD008A672BA4746C2CE02328A2AC0C39F951A3E5#1F532800020000000000000000000000
	```
    
7. Paste the code you made into the text field on the [Motorola page](https://en-us.support.motorola.com/app/standalone%2Fbootloader%2Funlock-your-device-b) that says "MAKE SURE YOUR DEVICE IS UNLOCKABLE".
    
    Then, click on the button that says "Can my device be unlocked?.
    
    You will receive a code by mail from Motorola in the next few minutes.
    
8. Once you receive the email with the code, type in the console `fastboot oem unlock "code"`, where "code" is the code that was sent to you by email, without the quotes.
    
9. Now on the phone you will get a screen that will ask you to confirm if you really want to unlock the bootloader, on this screen you will have to navigate with the volume keys and you can confirm with the power button. Confirm and wait about 20 seconds until the console displays `OKAY`.
    
10. Now simply reboot the system with `fastboot reboot` and you are done.
    
    If for some reason you want to relock the bootloader of the device, simply type `fastboot oem lock`. You will get the same confirmation screen, hit confirm and wait for the console to show an `OKAY`.
    
    I should point out that relocking the device has a risk of bricking the phone, so I don't recommend it.
