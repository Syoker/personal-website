In this guide, I will show you how to flash the official firmware of our device. This process will format your device, so I recommend you to make a backup before.

This is at your own risk, I'm not responsible for any damage caused to your device.

## **¿What I need?**

- ### **SDK Platform Tools**

  The _Android SDK Platform tools_ are a component of the Android SDK. They include tools that interact with the Android platform, such as <code><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb">adb</a></code>, <code><a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/fastboot/#fastboot">fastboot</a></code> y <code><a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/tracing/command-line">systrace</a></code>. These tools are required for Android app development, or if you want to unlock the bootloader of your device and update it with a new system image.

- ### **Motorola Drivers**

  This contains the USB drivers so that the PC can recognize your device and work with it when it is in Bootloader or Fastbootd.

- ### **Official firmware**

  You will need to download official firmware corresponding to your software channel for your device, **NEVER DOWNLOAD A FIRMWARE FROM ANOTHER CHANNEL.** To find out which firmware corresponds to your device, you need to look at the channel it belongs to in the settings app, under "About phone" in "Software Channel".

- ### **Windows Terminal (optional)**

  If you have windows 8, 8.1 or 10, download this terminal from the Windows Store, as you will get a feature that you will need in this guide. Once you have obtained the terminal, configure it so that the default profile is the command prompt (CMD).

  Download link - [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701)

- ### **USB debugging (optional)**

  In this guide we will use USB debugging to access the bootloader mode, it is not necessary if you are already in bootloader mode or if you are going to access it in another way (with a buttons combination), but I recommend the way it is going to be shown in this guide.

  To enable USB debugging, you have to go to the settings app, in the "About phone" section under "Build number" and tap 7 times. Then, you have to access the "Developer options" in the settings app under "System" and enable "USB debugging".

## **Procedure to flash the Stock Firmware**

1. Unzip the platform-tools folder obtained from the **Android Developers** page, then unzip the official firmware file obtained from **Mirrors Lolinet** and move all files from this folder to the platform-tools folder.

2. If you have the **Windows Terminal** obtained from the **Microsoft Store**, simply open the CMD inside the folder by right-clicking on an empty part of the folder and selecting the "Open in Terminal" option.

	If you don't have the **Windows Terminal**, inside the folder in an empty space, shift+right-click and select the option "Open PowerShell window here", type `cmd` inside the window and press enter.

3. Connect the device to the PC, type in the CMD `adb devices` (the phone has to be on for this command to work, in case it is already in bootloader, type `fastboot devices`) and press enter. If the console doesn't return
   ```bash
   List of devices   attached
   ZE222BZWFF        device
   ```
   then make sure you have your device properly connected, or have enabled USB debugging.
4. Now reboot to the bootloader (if you aren't in it) with `adb reboot bootloader` or with the key combination "volume - and power" (you have to hold down these buttons until the bootloader screen appears).

   Anyway, this will access the bootloader, which has a screen with text and the Android robot lying down with an open lid.

5. As a last step, if you do not have the bootloader unlocked, download the following bat and place it in the platform-tools folder.

   If you have the bootloader unlocked, then download the following bat and place it in the same folder (the platform-tools folder).

   [• Motorola One Fusion Bat - Unlock bootloader](/files/bat_unlockbootloader.bat)

   Once the bat is located in the folder, simply run it with a double click and it will take care of everything, once finished, it will reboot the device automatically.
