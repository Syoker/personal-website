In this guide, I will show you how to flash a Custom Recovery for your device.

All this is at your own risk, I'm not responsible for any damage caused to your device.

## **¿What I need?**

- ### **SDK Platform Tools**

  The _Android SDK Platform Tools_ are a component of the Android SDK. They include tools that interact with the Android platform, such as [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb"), [fastboot](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/fastboot/#fastboot) and [systrace](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/tracing/command-line). These tools are required for Android app development, or if you want to unlock the bootloader of your device and update it with a new system image.

  Download link - [SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

- ### **Motorola Drivers**

  This contains the USB drivers so that the PC can recognize your device and work with it when it is in Bootloader or Fastbootd.

- ### **Windows Terminal (optional)**

  If you have windows 8, 8.1 or 10, download this terminal from the Windows Store, as you will get a feature that you will need in this guide. Once you have obtained the terminal, configure it so that the default profile is the command prompt (CMD).

  Download link - [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701)

- ### **USB debugging (optional)**

  In this guide we will use USB debugging to access the bootloader mode, it is not necessary if you are already in bootloader mode or if you are going to access it in another way (with a buttons combination), but I recommend the way it is going to be shown in this guide.
  To enable USB debugging, you have to go to the settings app, in the "About phone" section under "Build number" and tap 7 times. Then, you have to access the "Developer options" in the settings app under "System" and enable "USB debugging".

- ### **Bootloader unlocked**

  You need to have unlocked the bootloader to be able to install a Custom Recovery on your device. If you haven't unlocked it yet, I'll leave you the link to the guide I made explaining step by step what you have to do.

- ### **Custom Recovery**

  Here are the links to the custom recoveries available on our device. Once downloaded, place the image in the same folder where the platform-Tools files are located.

## **Procedure to flash the Custom Recovery**.

1.  Unzip the platform-tools folder you got from the **Android Developers** page and paste the .img file of the previously downloaded custom recovery into the same folder.

    > Example folder

2.  If you have the **Windows Terminal** obtained from the **Microsoft Store**, simply open the CMD inside the folder by right-clicking on an empty part of the folder and selecting the "Open in Terminal" option.

    If you don't have the **Windows Terminal**, inside the folder in an empty space do shift + right click and select the option "Open in PowerShell window here", type `cmd` inside the window and press enter.

    > Demonstration video

3.  Now connect the device to the PC and type in CMD

    ```bash
    adb devices
    ```

    > The device has to be powered on for this command to work, in case it is already in bootloader, type `fastboot devices`.

    If the console does not return

    ```bash
    List of devices   attached
    ZE222BZWFF        device
    ```

    then make sure that you have the device properly connected, or that USB debugging is enabled.

4.  Now proceed to reboot the device to go to bootloader with the following command

    ```bash
    adb reboot bootloader
    ```

    > You can also access this mode with the power + volume down key combination.

    You will know you are in bootloader mode as it has a screen with text and the Android robot lying down with an open lid.

5.  Once in bootloader, flash the recovery on both partitions of the device with:

    ```bash
    fastboot flash recovery_a "customrecovery.img".
    fastboot flash recovery_b "customrecovery.img"
    ```

    > Where "customrecovery.img" is the name of the recovery file, without quotes and with the ".img".

6.  Now reboot into recovery with

    ```bash
    fastboot reboot recovery
    ```

    and that's it, you're in recovery.

Now that you are in recovery, make a backup copy of the EFS, Modem and Persist folders and save it on a micro SD card or on the computer, as it will be useful if for some reason you lose the IMEI.
