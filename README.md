# Personal Website

This is my personal page made in React with NextJS and TypeScript, using MDX for the articles, and Next-Translate to support English and Spanish.

## Requirements to build the project

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [NodeJS 18.16.1 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)

## How to build this project

1. First, clone the repository with
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Syoker/personal-website
   ```
2. Then, install all modules with
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. After you have installed the modules, build the page with
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. And finally, mount the page on a port with
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   > NOTE: By default, Next will mount the page on port 3000, you can change the port by doing `npm start -- --port 3001` being 3001 the port where you want to start the project.
